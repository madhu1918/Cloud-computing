			"text": "The relationship0 \"friend\" is often symmetric, meaning that if I am your friend, you are my friend. Implement a MapReduce algorithm to check whether this property holds. Generate a list of all nonsymmetric friend relationships.<br><br><b>Map Input</b>Each input record is a 2 element list [personA, personB] where personA is a string representing the name of a person and personB is a string representing the name of one of personA's friends. Note that it may or may not be the case that the personA is a friend of personB.<br><br><b>Reducer Output</b><br>The output should be all pairs (friend, person) such that (person, friend) appears in the dataset but (friend, person) does not.<br>You can test your solution to this problem using friends.json:<br>python asymmetric_friendships.py friends.json<br><br>You can verify your solution by comparing your result with the le asymmetric_friendships.json."
