			"text": "Consider a simple social network dataset consisting of a set of key-value pairs (person, friend) representing a friend relationship between two people. Describe a MapReduce algorithm to count the number of friends for each person.<br><br><b>Map Input</b><br>Each input record is a 2 element list [personA, personB] where personA is a string representing the name of a person and personB is a string representing the name of one of personA's friends. Note that it may or may not be the case that the personA is a friend of personB.<br><br><b>Reducer Output</b><br>The output should be a pair (person, friend_count) where person is a string and friend_count is an integer indicating the number of friends associated with person.<br>You can test your solution to this problem using friends.json:<br>python friend_count.py friends.json<br><br>You can verify your solution by comparing your result with the le friend_count.json."
